# Installation

## Installing to IRIDA

Please download the provided `irida-plugin-mlst-[version].jar` from the [releases][] page and copy to your `/etc/irida/plugins` directory.  Now you may start IRIDA and you should see the pipeline appear in your list of pipelines.

*Note:* This plugin requires you to be running IRIDA version >= `19.01`. Please see the [IRIDA][] documentation for more details.

## Installing Galaxy Dependencies

In order to use this pipeline, you will also have to install the [mlst][], [quast][], and [shovill][] (for assembly) Galaxy tools within your Galaxy instance. These can be found at:

| Name    | Version  | Galaxy Tool                                                    |
|---------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| mlst    | `2.16.1` | <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/mlst/1f5641a52664>    |
| quast   | `5.0.2`  | <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/quast/81df4950d65b>   |
| shovill | `1.0.4`  | <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/shovill/865119fcb694> |

# Usage

## Monitoring Pipeline Status

To monitor the status of the launched pipeline, please select the **Analyses > Your Analyses** menu.

From here, you can monitor the status of your pipeline.

## Analysis Results

Once the analysis pipeline is finished, you can view the analysis results in your browser or download the files to your machine.

![mlst-results.png][]

These results include the MLST profile as generated by [mlst][], and a summary of the quality of the assembly generated by [shovill][]. 
The assembly quality summary is generated by [quast][].

## Metadata Table

If you selected the **Save Results to Project Line List Metadata** option when launching the pipeline, the MLST scheme and sequence type will be integrated into the IRIDA Line List/Metadata table as shown below.

# Building

## Installing IRIDA Libraries

To build this plugin yourself, you must first install [IRIDA][] to your local Maven repository. Please make sure you are installing the IRIDA version defined in the `irida.version.compiletime` property in the [pom.xml][] file (e.g., `19.01.3`). Or, alternatively, please update the IRIDA dependency version in the `pom.xml` file.

To install the IRIDA libraries to a local Maven repository, please run the following from within the [IRIDA][] project (the `irida/` directory):

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Building MLST Plugin

Once IRIDA is installed, you may build the pipeline plugin by running the following in this project's directory (the `irida-plugin-mlst/` directory):

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This should produce a `target/*.jar` file, which can be copied into `/etc/irida/plugins/`.
